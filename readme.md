# ðŸš€LLM Art Work

### This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, such as vector databases, while remaining open to broader innovations.

#### While we focus on all aspects of AI based application development - currently our efforts is towards Vectordatabases.

### FAISS 

#### Faiss is a popular vectordatabase with a wide-spread implementation.
#### From Faiss perspective covered items are:
> L2Flat Indexing

> IVF Indexing

> HNSW Indexing

> Performance comparison of all listed methods

> Workflow - achieved using Langchain and Faiss


> ### Note:
> All these tests and development has been conducted over:
>> 2 Core (4 Core with Hyper-threading)
> 
>> 16 GB RAM
> 
>> Windows 11


### To build or test all the implementations provided. 
1. Please go to vectordatases/ folder
2. Either execute locally or over a platform any of the vector databases
