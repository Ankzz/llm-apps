# üöÄLLM Art Corner

![alt text](LLMArtCorner.png "LLM Art Corner")

### This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, such as vector databases, while remaining open to broader innovations.

#### While we focus on all aspects of AI based application development - currently our efforts is towards Vectordatabases.

### FAISS 

#### Faiss is a popular vectordatabase with a wide-spread implementation.
#### From Faiss perspective covered items are:
> L2Flat Indexing

> IVF Indexing

> HNSW Indexing

> Performance comparison of all listed methods

> Workflow - achieved using Langchain and Faiss


> ### Note:
> All these tests and development has been conducted over:
>> 2 Core (4 Core with Hyper-threading)
> 
>> 16 GB RAM
> 
>> Windows 11


### To build or test all the implementations provided. 
1. Please go to vectordatases/ folder
2. Either execute locally or over a platform any of the vector databases

## üîé **Top Vector Databases for Similarity Search**

### **1. Milvus**
‚úÖ **Open-source** and scalable vector database.  
‚úÖ Designed for handling large-scale datasets with billions of vectors.  
‚úÖ Provides features like **sharding**, **replication**, and **dynamic schema**.  
‚úÖ Supports integrations with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face.

**Use Case:** Ideal for large-scale recommendation systems and AI-driven search.  

---

### **2. Weaviate**
‚úÖ An open-source, **schema-free** vector search engine.  
‚úÖ Supports hybrid search (vector + keyword search).  
‚úÖ Offers **real-time updates** and a **GraphQL API** for queries.  
‚úÖ Supports **vectorizers** like OpenAI, Cohere, and Hugging Face directly.  

**Use Case:** Great for combining text, image, and structured data in search.  

---

### **3. ChromaDB**
‚úÖ Open-source and built specifically for **AI-native applications**.  
‚úÖ Simple Python API for fast integration.  
‚úÖ Supports **metadata filtering** and **embeddings storage**.  
‚úÖ Commonly used with **LLM apps** like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).  

**Use Case:** Best for AI chatbots, LLM-powered search, and dynamic content retrieval.  

---

### **4. Qdrant**
‚úÖ Open-source vector search engine with **high performance**.  
‚úÖ Features include **payload filtering**, **distributed deployment**, and **scalability**.  
‚úÖ Written in Rust for optimal performance.  

**Use Case:** Suitable for real-time applications like fraud detection or recommendation engines.  

---

### **5. Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**
‚úÖ Developed by Spotify, designed for **fast, read-only** search.
